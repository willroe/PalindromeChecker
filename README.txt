1) Choosing 1 will give the user the option to run a Palindrome program where
    the user enters in a word or statement and the program determines if it's a
    palindrome. This program also includes spaces as part of the palindrome so
    a statement such as "never odd or even" would be considered "Not a Palindrome".
    If the user entered in "neveroddoreven" this would be condsidered
    "Is A Palindrome".

2) Choosing 2 will quit the program.

  Bugs: No known bugs.
